                                             ROLL NO.-210101060
                                             ASSIGNMENT-3


QUESTION 1:-
-----------

ASSUMPTION- the game will end if there is only one person left

python code file name"210101060_Assign03q1.py",
command to run - "python filename"
                -"python 210101060_Assign03q1.py"

explanation of code- 

-> first of all I take input no of person and skip number from user.
-> then I make a list and assign a number to each person from 1 to n.
-> then i ran a while loop untill the number of killed person is n-1
   in which a person kills a person which is skip number left to him.

QUESTION 2:-
----------
NOTE-Here I use "hueristic method" that will not gives us the optimal solution (solution with minimum steps) 
     but it will gives us the solution with in minimum time with respect to other method.

python code file name "210101060_Assign03q2.py",
command to run -  "python filename"
                  "python 210101060_Assign03q2.py",

explaintion of code-
-> firt of all I make function " inversion()" for Counting the inversion value of a given matrix
 that will be used in if_solve function.
->then i make function "if_solvable()" for checking if puzzel is solvable or not

->then i make function "misplaced()" for Counting the number of misplaced tiles for a state of the 8 puzzle

->then i make function "print_in_format() " that will print the list in matrix formate

->then i make the fuction "bestmove()" that will give us the matrix that will have least number of misplaced tiles after moving blank tile one time

->then i take unsolved initial puzzle in input from user
->then i take goal puzzle in input from user
->then i make make a list "list_of_state" that will contain first 10 states
->then i code accordingly

-> at last I print the first 10 steps if it is solvable in less than or equal to 10 steps
-> if it is not possible to solve puzzle in 10 steps then it will print "reachable but it will take more than 10 steps" .
